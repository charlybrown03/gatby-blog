description: This is a thanksgiving to the people who have brought me here
---

In my first blog post, I'm trying to recap about the people and actions
that have taken me to where I am now.

First of all, I want to thank
[Quim Granados](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quimgranados/)
and [Igor Modino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-modino-p%C3%A9rez-83426539/),
who trust during my internship at [eSportics](https://www.esportics.com/es/),
and where I begin to lear what a frontend means, after using Java executed 99%
of the time from the line of commands. I discovered WTF is a CSS file, and how it
is related with the HTML elements, and of course, jQuery, with the DOM interaction,
and met Ajax and the async request and callback functions. At that moment, I had
no idea about what I was doing, but I got out of the databases, except for some
PHP stuff, and began to learn how to build and interact with a flexible and nice UI.
