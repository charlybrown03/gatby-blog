In my first blog post, I'm trying to recap about the people and actions
that have taken me to where I am now.

To give a little context about my background, I studied DAM (Multiplatform
Application Development), where I learned Java, a little bit of Python and
DataBases management.

#### Now we can start!

And before starting to recap, I want to also thank
[Quim Granados](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quimgranados/),
[Vanessa Palmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palmervanessa/), and
[Igor Modino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-modino-p%C3%A9rez-83426539/),
who trust on me during my internship at [eSportics](https://www.esportics.com/es/),
and where I began to learn what to be a frontend mean, after develop with Java
executed 99% of the time from the command line.

I discovered WTF a CSS file is, and how it is related to the HTML elements,
and of course, jQuery, with the DOM interaction, Ajax and the async
requests and callback functions... At that moment, I had no idea about what I
was doing, but I got out of the databases, except for some PHP stuff, and I
began to learn how to build and interact with a flexible and nice UI, and
I began to enjoy myself as a child do.

After ending my internship and my studies, I started to look for a developer job at...
InfoJobs. It was the wrong decision. I only found underpaid and unattractive job positions.
Then, I continue working at the warehouse as I never studied anything, but playing with
[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/), also taking a very
helpful at the beginning online courses at [Patzi](https://platzi.com/).

But everything changed in April 2016, when a friend and fellow student,
[Biel Conde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biel-conde-manyoses-45131286/),
who was working as a frontend team lead, decided to call me to a job interview
where needed skills were... PHP and Angular.

> Oh, I know how to manage this kind of application!

![Angular meme](./angular-meme.jpg)

Spoiler: **the real world is not that easy**, we had an underperforming app with
a lot of bugs and bad practices, where we need to put order and new features at the same time. Here
I learned what a professional frontend developer must do.

We worked a lot to accomplish it, but two months later, the company decided to start the
project again from the roots with a new approach, without using (magic) frameworks where
the developers can easily lose control of what it's happening.

At this moment, another fundamental factor appears. The company hired
[Germ치n Robledo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/germanrcuriel/), and we began creating a
[Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/) + [Marionette](https://marionettejs.com/) application.
Using a less magic framework than the old Angular 1.5, I learned a lot about JS listeners
and how to manage it in a way that doesn't compromise the app performance, taking care of how
do you achieve a result in the fastest way.

I remember with special love this period, I remember that, as a super junior developer,
see and contribute into how a new application was born, gives me an especial relation with the project.
In a few time, I can code alone without any problem, of course I'd got a lot of PR comments to improve
the code, but it was crucial to began to refine my **code quality**, thinking that the code must
do only what it supose to do, must be self-explanatory, understandable, and readable by other people.

But Germ치n leaves the company in May 2017, and start working at my actual company, as a frontend team lead
(of himself). And a **week ago**...

> Hi Carlos! Do you remember me from last week that we were working together?  
> I'm creating a team!

I accepted the proposal, and we hired Biel again, that was working in his own company, but wants to
change his workplace.

Here, we met [Gloria Hornero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gloriahornero/), from whom
I learned a lot about testing (and **Ruby** as a gift that I'd used after to build into a
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) project), but I consider testing to be my weak point yet today,
not implement the tests but know what should be tested.

![Tests meme](./tests-meme.jpg)

After German leaves the company and Biel began as a team lead, we started seriously doing
[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) things, what we were playing but not using in production. We created a
Vue components library and started creating Vue projects to standardize it as a frontend, very
chaotic at the beginning, but a very nice project step by step.

And here we go at this moment, learning a lot every single day, working into our
[NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) applications, using both **universal** and **SPA** mode,
creating tests (sometimes from a [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) implementation)
with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) + [VTL](https://github.com/testing-library/vue-testing-library)
and working in a great and multidisciplinary team where all of us contribute into SEO, analytics, best practices,
simpler and more performant applications, etc. At this moment we are not perfect at all, but we are introducing
improvement after improvement to achieve the fastest iteration and better product quality.

And that's a very compacted summary about how my last ~4 years, I changed my boring job into a challenging
and funny one.
